## Introduction

This repository contains a wide range of DSA practice problems that cover different topics and difficulty levels. The problems are designed to be solved using popular programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, and more. Each problem is accompanied by a clear problem statement, input/output specifications, and example test cases to guide you through the problem-solving process.

The practice problems in this repository are carefully crafted to cover a variety of concepts, including but not limited to:

- Array manipulation
- Linked lists
- Stacks and queues
- Trees and graphs
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Dynamic programming
- Recursion
- Backtracking
- And more!
